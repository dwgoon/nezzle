# Nezzle

Nezzle is a programmable and interactive visualization software
for creating high-quality figures of small-scale networks.
Nezzle repesents **Ne**t + Pu**zzle**,
because adjusting nodes and edges of a network for visualization
is similar to playing a puzzle :)

  
## Features
- Lightweight, programmable, detailed visualization of small-scale networks for high quality figures.
- Highly customizable visualization of networks with user-defined source codes.
- Manual curation of the positions of nodes and edges by adjusting the graphics in GUI.
- Interactive programming to modify both data and graphics of networks in the GUI console.
- The GUI depends on Python bindings for [`Qt`](https://www.qt.io/)
  such as [`PyQt`](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt)
  (abstracted by [`QtPy`](https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy) in this project).
