## Introduction 
- Nezzle is a network visualization software using both programming and GUI, written in Python.
- Initially, Nezzle development began to visualize biological networks such as signaling networks.
- Nezzle repesents **Ne**t + Pu**zzle**, because adjusting nodes and edges of a network for visualization is 
  similar to playing a puzzle.
  
## Features
- Lightweight, programmable, detailed visualization for small-scale networks.
- Network visualization automation by applying their source codes.
- Manual curation of the positions of nodes and edges by adjusting the graphics in GUI.
- Interactive programming to modify both data and graphics of networks in the GUI console.
- The GUI depends on Python bindings for [`Qt`](https://www.qt.io/)
  such as [`PyQt`](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt)
  (abstracted by [`QtPy`](https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy) in this project).
