## Introduction 
- Nezzle is a programmable and interactive visualization software for small-scale networks (N < 100).
- Nezzle was initially developed to visualize biological networks such as 
  [signaling networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23643-5).
- Nezzle repesents **Ne**t + Pu**zzle**, because adjusting nodes and edges of a network for visualization is similar to playing a puzzle.
- Nezzle is currently under active development.
-  Consider ["Cytoscape"](https://cytoscape.org/) or ["Gephi"](https://gephi.org/) for large-scale networks.
 
## Features
- Lightweight, programmable, detailed visualization of small-scale networks for high quality figures.
- Highly customizable visualization of networks with user-defined source codes.
- Manual curation of the positions of nodes and edges by adjusting the graphics in GUI.
- Interactive programming to modify both data and graphics of networks in the GUI console.
- The GUI depends on Python bindings for [`Qt`](https://www.qt.io/)
  such as [`PyQt`](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt)
  (abstracted by [`QtPy`](https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy) in this project).
